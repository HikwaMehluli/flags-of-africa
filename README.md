# üåç Flags of Africa Memory Game üåç

## An exciting and educational journey into the heart of Africa!

Have you ever noticed the lack of fun, interactive, and educational content about Africa? This project was born out of a desire to change that! We believe in making learning about Africa's rich and diverse cultures an engaging experience for everyone.

This memory game is more than just a game; it's an adventure that will test your knowledge and teach you about the beautiful flags of the 54 nations that make up the African continent. Get ready to challenge your memory, learn some geography, and have a blast doing it!
