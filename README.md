The countries and their flags are based on the official [Regions of the African Union](https://au.int/en/member_states/countryprofiles2). The African Union (AU) is made up of 55 Member States which represent all the countries on the African continent. AU Member States are divided into five geographic regions. which were defined by the Organization of African Unity (OAU) in 1976 (CM/Res.464QCXVI).

The OAU is the predecessor of the AU. The OAU was a continental body established in 1963 to promote unity and solidarity among African states and to coordinate cooperation for a better life for the people of Africa. The OAU was later replaced by the African Union (AU) in 2002.
